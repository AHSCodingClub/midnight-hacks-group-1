# Delirium
## Midnight Hacks - Group 1

## Inspiration
What inspired us to create this project was a reflection on our mental health during COVID-19, especially highlighting the effects of coping with losing loved ones during this time. We wanted to use our knowledge of coding to generate a sense of understanding for people who have yet to feel the effects of COVID mentally and emotionally.

## What It Does
Our text adventure gives the user an interactive portrayal of what some people have encountered during COVID that is filled with mini-games to make the project more engaging.

## How We Built It
We built this project using C++ and divided the work into 4 portions, the mini-game, the text, the illustrations, and the storyline.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Some challenges we faced were implementing the mini-games for example, tic-tac-toe, into our text adventure.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Some accomplishments we're proud of are being able to work as a team that managed to work together on the same project while not meeting in person and finding a project that we all enjoyed working together on.

## What We Learned
We learned how to render art in C++ using keyboard symbols.

## What's Next for Delirium
We plan to display it at our school's next art exhibit so people can appreciate our project.
